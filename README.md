# Nightly Engine ðŸŒ™

A modern, lightweight and cross-platform engine that makes game development fun again.

## Current state

The engine is currently in development and is not fully functional. The latest version can be found in the `development` branch and stable versions will have their own branches in the
future. If you'd like to try out the engine, you can follow the steps below to build it from source. If you'd like to
contribute, you're welcome!

## Building from source

Follow these steps to build Nightly from source:

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Futureblur/NightlyEngine.git`
- Go to the engine directory: `cd NightlyEngine`
- Install all the submodules: `git submodule update --init`

After that, follow the specific instructions for your OS down below.



### Mac

1. Install CMake. If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index), run this command: `brew install cmake`
2. Install the latest version of [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/xcode/id497799835?l=en).
3. Install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Again, if you use homebrew, run this command: `brew install python`
4. Open your terminal and navigate to the `Scripts` folder.
5. Generate your Xcode project files using: `python3 ./GenerateXcode.py`
6. Launch the editor: `python3 ./LaunchEditor.py`

Your project files will be written to `Engine/Build/{Configuration}/Engine/Source`, while the binaries will be stored in `Engine/Binaries`.<br>
If you get an error message telling you that the `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` or `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` could not be found,
run: `sudo xcode-select --reset`.



### Linux

1. Python 3 is required. If not already installed, do it now: `sudo apt install python`
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the `Scripts` folder: `cd Scripts`
3. Install all the dependencies: `python3 ./InstallLinuxDependencies.py`
4. Generate and build the project: `python3 ./GenerateNinja.py`
5. Launch the editor: `python3 ./LaunchEditor.py`

Your project files will be written to `Engine/Build/{Configuration}/Engine/Source`, while the binaries will be stored in `Engine/Binaries`. You can now open the project using
an IDE like CLion.



### Windows

1. Download and install
   CMake [here](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.23.1/cmake-3.23.1-windows-x86_64.msi). Make sure
   the full path to `cmake.exe` is added to your PATH.
2. Download and install python3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Download the latest release of ninja [here](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases/tag/v1.10.2). Unzip the
   folder into a directory you wish. Add the full path to `ninja.exe` to your PATH.
4. Download and install the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) and make sure you check the option **Desktop development with C++** in the installer. On the right hand side, check the option **C++ Clang tools for Windows** to also install the clang compiler.
5. Open your terminal and navigate into the `Scripts` folder.
6. Generate and build the project: `python ./GenerateNinja.py`
7. Launch the editor: `python ./LaunchEditor.py`

Your project files will be written to `Engine/Build/{Configuration}/Engine/Source`, while the binaries will be stored in `Engine/Binaries`. You can now open the project using
an IDE like Visual Studio or CLion.
